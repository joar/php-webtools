# PHP Web Tools

This is a PHP class that might be useful when you are developing smaller 
standalone applications that does not run on a framework.

The original class is originally from  [github.com/Hamsterpaj/hamsterpaj4][1] 
but some code, like the `tools::json_indent()` is taken from other sources
and some changes are made.
